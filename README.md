# MiniFlowRb
Basic TensorFlow version in Ruby to learn two concepts at the heart of neural networks - backpropagation and differentiable graphs.

This Neural Network library is built following the MiniFlow lesson in the Self-driving Car Nanodegree at Udacity.
The introduction in the lesson is as follows:

> Backpropagation is the process by which neural networks update the weights of the network over time.
>
>Differentiable graphs are graphs where the nodes are differentiable functions. They are also useful as visual aids for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives. This is the fundamental abstraction of TensorFlow - it's a framework for creating differentiable graphs.
>
>With graphs and backpropagation, you will be able to create your own nodes and properly compute the derivatives. Even more importantly, you will be able to think and reason in terms of these graphs.
